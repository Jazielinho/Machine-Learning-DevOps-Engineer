# Lesson Introduction: Working with Others Using Version Control

Though you should already be comfortable with using version control for your own projects, this lesson will prepare you to use version control with a team. First, there will be a short review of key commands for working with git and Github on your own:

1. `git add`
2. `git commit`
3. `git push`

Next, you will learn how to

1. `Create branches`
2. `Use git and Github for different workflows`
3. `Perform code reviews`

Be sure to practice each of these areas using the quizzes and exercises. The best way to ensure you are taking away the key concepts is to practice! If you get stuck, there are solutions and walkthroughs for you to follow along with or check your solution. Each of these areas is key to performing machine learning tasks in the workplace.


# Working Independently
## Creating a new GitHub repository
In the above video, you saw how to create a new Github repository. Next, let's take a look at a common workflow for adding new files or updates.

A common flow for making these changes means using three common git commands including:

1. `git add`
2. `git commit`
3. `git push`

This lesson provides some specifics of working with version control in a team, production setting. The tasks will be relatively specific. If you are looking for a more general course on git, please check out the course linked below.
